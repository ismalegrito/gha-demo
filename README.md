# What is Prompt?

A **prompt** is essentially a natural language request, question, instruction, or even a combination of these that you give to an AI model.

Copilot prompts are instructions or questions you use to tell Copilot what you want. Prompts can include four parts: the **goal**, **context**, **expectations**, and **source**.

## Goal
What do you want from Copilot?

**Example:**
> I want a list of 3-5 bullet points to prepare me.

## Context
Why do you need it, and who is involved?

**Example:**
> I want a list of 3-5 bullet points to prepare me for an upcoming meeting with [client], focusing on their current state and what they are looking to achieve.

## Expectations
How should Copilot respond to best fulfill your request?

**Example:**
> I want a list of 3-5 bullet points to prepare me for an upcoming meeting with [client], focusing on their current state and what they are looking to achieve. Respond with a tone that is friendly but authoritative.

## Source
What information or samples do you want Copilot to use?

**Example:**
> I want a list of 3-5 bullet points to prepare me for an upcoming meeting with [client], focusing on their current state and what they are looking to achieve. Respond with a tone that is friendly but authoritative. Focus on email and Teams chats with [people] over the last two weeks.
